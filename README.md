This project, authored by me and my colleague explores the precession of Mercury, a fascinating phenomenon in planetary science. It delves into the historical context, theoretical foundations including the Runge-Lenz Vector and Leapfrog Method with Time Transformation, and presents simulation results showcasing the gradual shift in Mercury's orbit. The study highlights the significance of this precession in testing Einstein's theory of general relativity and advancing our understanding of gravity and spacetime. It underscores the role of computational methods in gaining insights into complex celestial phenomena and encourages continued scientific exploration.
